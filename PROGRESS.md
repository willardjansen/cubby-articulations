## How to Contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Quick checklist:**
1. Maps must be your own creation OR from an open-source project
2. NO commercial/proprietary maps (Art Conductor, etc.)
3. Include proper attribution in meta.yaml
4. Test that articulations work correctly
